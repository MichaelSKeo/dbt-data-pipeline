Overview:

The first section of this document outlines the short-term ETL solution including the trade-offs, omissions, and areas to spend additional time on for processing external lead data files into the CRM platform, downstream dashboards, and answering business questions. The second section provides long-term ELT strategies to ensure scalability, data quality, and efficiency in handling large datasets with evolving schemas.

1. Short-term ETL solution:

Key Assumptions:
- Input: Three CSV files and a SDFC extract for existing load.
- Output: A consolidated dataset ready for Salesforce upload, dashboards, and analysis.
- Tools: Use lightweight, accessible tools (e.g., Python, pandas, dbt, duckdb) for rapid development.

Implementation Process:
- Ingestion: Use Python to load and validate CSV files into ‘duckdb’ database schema.
- Cleaning and Validation: Standardize columns, break atomic fields, and create derived columns in staging.
- Transformation: Use dbt to union datasets, deduplicate leads, and build metrics for SFDC and dashboards.
- Materialization: Set staging models to ‘view’, intermediate to ‘ephemeral’, and final models to ‘table’ for storage and performance optimization.
- Testing: Apply completeness and not null tests for staging and intermediate models.
- Integrate CI/CD for Testing and Deployment: Use GitHub Actions to implement automated testing (e.g. dbt test runs, Python unit tests) and deployment pipelines.

Tradeoffs Made:
- Minimal Automation: Focused on semi-automated processes (e.g., Python scripts) to rapidly implement the solution. Hence, scalability and reliability are limited without a pipeline orchestration tool.
- Limited Schema Management: Handled schema changes manually. Adapting to significant changes in input file structures could delay processing.
- Simplified Error Handling: Basic logging or flagging instead of robust error recovery mechanisms. Manual interventions are required if ingestion or transformation failures.

Omissions:
- Advanced Data Enrichment: Omitted external API calls or external datasets for enriching leads (e.g., demographic, firmographic, or intent data). Incorporating these would improve lead quality and scoring accuracy.
- Comprehensive Testing: Limited testing to functional validations (e.g. not null, completeness checks). A robust testing framework with integration, and regression tests could be added for long-term reliability.
- Performance Optimization: No focus on optimizing database queries or file processing for datasets larger than the current 100GB scale. Additional time could be spent tuning SQL queries or using distributed data processing tools like Spark.
- Data Quality Rules Engine: Left out a more dynamic approach to defining and applying data quality rules (e.g. leveraging a tool like Great Expectations). Adding this could enhance validation and ensure confidence.

What I Would Do Differently with Additional Time:
- Scalable Storage and Processing: Transition storage to a cloud data warehouse (e.g. Snowflake, Redshift) and processing to distributed frameworks (e.g. Spark) for big datasets.
- Pipeline Orchestration: Use Airflow to manage the ETL pipeline, schedule monthly file ingestion, and handle failures.
- Monitoring and Alerting: Add monitoring tools (e.g., Datadog) to track pipeline performance and alert on errors or anomalies.
- Dynamic Schema Handling: Implement schema inference using libraries like pandas-profiling or data classes to adapt to varying input file structures dynamically.
- Stakeholder Involvement: Involvement and domain knowledge from key stakeholders could improve the outputs, increase adoption of the data assets and tools, and potential generate revenue based on the strategy and execution.

2. Long-term ETL strategic recommendation

Key Assumptions:
- Data is sourced from external systems and delivered monthly.
- Files contain a full refresh of existing and new records.
- Input file size: ~100GB.
- File schemas are subject to change without notice.
- Leads must be processed and made available for outreach promptly.

Recommended Process:
- Scalable Architecture: Use cloud platforms (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery) for efficient handling of 100GB data with schema-on-read for flexibility and partitioning for performance.
- Automated Ingestion: Use tools like Fivetran or Airflow to automate monthly file loading and validate file integrity during upload (e.g. file size, format checks).
- Data Staging: Centralize raw data in a staging layer for auditing, versioning, and schema tracking.
- Data Cleaning: Deduplicate leads, normalize fields, validate schemas, and log errors for quality assurance.
- QA Testing: Automate data quality tests (e.g., nulls, duplicates) with dbt, monitor pipelines using observability tools, and sample for manual validation.
- Data Enrichment: Append external attributes (e.g., industry, revenue), validate contacts via APIs, and enrich leads with CRM attributes for lead scoring and predictive model.
- Downstream Modeling: Design star schemas, capture lead lifecycle changes, and link leads with business dimensions for analytics.
- Process Automation: Orchestrate workflows end-to-end using Airflow, handle schema changes dynamically, and automate dashboard updates.
- Governance: Establish ownership, enforce access controls, document pipelines, and archive outdated files to optimize costs.
- Outreach Enablement: Publish processed leads to CRMs, implement lead-scoring models, and ensure timely access for sales teams.
